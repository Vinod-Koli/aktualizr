This is the second step in getting a new board running after xref:add-board-class.adoc[adding a new board class for the new target board in meta-updater].

This step involves getting Yocto to build a physical image with the partitions in the correct place, with the necessary modifications for OSTree. The standard approach here is to use https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.7/dev-manual/dev-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic[Wic, the OpenEmbedded Image Creator].

You will need to create a Wic Kickstart file that places the necessary firmware in memory where the board needs it to be. Typically, board vendors will provide a table with the memory layout of the boardâ€™s firmware.

Once you complete this step, you can proceed to the final step of xref:add-meta-updater-to-vendors-sdk.adoc[adding meta-updater features to the vendor's SDK].
